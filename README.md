Being developed in Java, DEEP promises to revolutionize criminal forensic analysis using Artificial Intelligence to help
investigators and forensic professionals solve cases from different criminal areas.

* <b>Digital</b>: Reflects the focus on technology and digital data, which are crucial in modern forensic analyses.

* <b>Evidence</b>: Emphasizes the system's primary goal, which is to handle evidence in criminal cases.

* <b>Evaluation</b>: Indicates that the system not only collects but also evaluates the evidence, a crucial step in
  forensic analysis.

* <b>Profiler</b>: Suggests that the system goes beyond mere evidence evaluation to also provide a more in-depth profile
  or analysis, which can be especially useful in complex investigations.
